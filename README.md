# gSuiteCalendarSync
This script allows you to create and update a mirror of your gSuite Calendar on a personal calendar on your gmail account. This script will automatically create, update and delete events on your personal calendar according to changes made in the gSuite account. This code was created as a temporary workaround for current google assistant limitation to access gSuite calendars.
By creating a time trigger in your google apps to run this code periodically (for example every 1 minute), the mirror calendar is kept up to date.
