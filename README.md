# gSuiteCalendarSync
This script allows you to create and update a mirror of your gSuite Calendar on a personal calendar on your gmail account. This script will create, update and delete events on your personal calendar according to changes made in the gSuite account. This code was created as a temporary workaround for current google assistant limitation to access gSuite calendars.
